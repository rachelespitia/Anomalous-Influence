    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <H2> Anomalous influence is back! join the waitling list to know when the upcoming tour is.
        after the death of Patrick, the band was put on hold. Overcome by grief, Josie, Dip, Pip and Tink took a break from the band. 
        A few months after, our world was overcome by terror and despair during the monster apocalypse.
         Now, that we have all found a way to unite once more our zombie/vampire band has come back from the dead.
         NEW ALBUM ORIGINS COMING SOON!
